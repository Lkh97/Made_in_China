## Abstract:
As large language models increasingly mediate access to information and facilitate decision-making, they are becoming instruments in soft power competitions between global actors such as the United States and China. So far, language models seem to be aligned with the values of Western countries, but evidence for this ethical bias comes mostly from models made by American companies. The current crop of state-of-the-art models includes several made in China, so we conducted the first large-scale investigation of how models made in China and the USA align with people from China and the USA. We elicited responses to the Moral Foundations Questionnaire 2.0 and the World Values Survey from ten Chinese models and ten American models, and we compared their responses to responses from thousands of Chinese and American people. We found that all 20 models respond to both surveys more like American people than like Chinese people. This skew toward American values is only slightly mitigated when prompting the models in Chinese or imposing a Chinese persona on the models. On the Moral Foundations Questionnaire 2.0, language models and American people prioritize caring for others more than Chinese people do, on average, which is consistent with alignment methods that emphasize harmlessness. On the World Values Survey, language models and American people express more positive attitudes toward homosexuality and casual sex and more negative attitudes toward defrauding the government and corporal punishment than Chinese people do. These findings have important implications for a near future in which large language models generate much of the content people consume and shape normative influence in geopolitics.
